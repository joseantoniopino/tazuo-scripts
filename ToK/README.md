# Tomb of Kings - Entrance Automation

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete & Stable  
**Author:** Foruno  
**For:** TazUO (Ultima Online)

---

## üìñ Description

Automates the tedious entrance puzzle at **Tomb of Kings**. The entrance requires pulling 12 levers and speaking two magic phrases at sacred flames - a repetitive and time-consuming task. This script handles it all automatically while you focus on the dungeon.

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Detects all 12 levers in the entrance area
- ‚úÖ Paints usable levers green for visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Auto-pulls levers when you walk adjacent to them
- ‚úÖ Detects Flame of Order and Flame of Chaos after all levers used
- ‚úÖ Auto-speaks correct phrases at flames ("Ord" / "Anord")
- ‚úÖ Stops automatically when entrance is complete

**Zero manual input required** - Just walk around near the levers!

## üéÆ How to Use

### 1. Preparation
- Go to **Tomb of Kings entrance** (the lever puzzle area)
- Stand anywhere near the levers

### 2. Load Script
- Click **"Legion Script"** in the TazUO menu bar (top of window)
- Select `tomb_of_kings.py` from the list
- Script starts automatically

### 3. Watch the Magic
The script will:
1. **Scan the area** (25 tile radius)
2. **Detect all levers** - Paints usable ones **green**
3. **Wait for you** to walk near levers
4. **Auto-pull levers** when you're adjacent (1 tile away)
5. **Mark used levers** - Changes to **red** after pulled
6. **Detect flames** - After all 12 levers pulled, Flames appear
7. **Auto-speak phrases:**
   - Flame of Order ‚Üí Says "Ord"
   - Flame of Chaos ‚Üí Says "Anord"
8. **Stop automatically** - Script ends when both flames activated

### 4. Enter Dungeon
Once script stops, the entrance is open. Walk in and enjoy!

## üé® Visual Feedback

The script uses colored hues to show lever status:

- **Green (üü¢)** - Usable lever (not yet pulled)
- **No color** - Used lever (wrong name)

**Note:** Colors are client-side only. Other players won't see them.

---

## üîß Configuration

### No Config File Needed!

This script has **zero configuration**. Just load and run.

### Customizable Values (Advanced)

If you want to modify behavior, edit these constants in the script:

```python
# At top of TombOfKings class
LEVER_GRAPHICS = [4238, 4236]  # Lever graphic IDs
USE_DISTANCE = 1               # Distance to auto-use (tiles)
DETECTION_RANGE = 25           # Detection radius (tiles)
```

**Most users never need to change these.**

## üêõ Debug Mode

If the script doesn't work as expected:

### Enable Debug Logging

1. Open `tomb_of_kings.py` in text editor
2. Find (near line 30):
   ```python
   DEBUG = False
   ```
3. Change to:
   ```python
   DEBUG = True
   ```
4. Save and reload script
5. Reproduce the issue
6. Check `ToK/logs/tomb_of_kings-YYYYMMDD.log`

### What Gets Logged

When debug mode is enabled:
- Lever detection events
- Distance calculations
- Lever use attempts
- Flame detection
- Speech events
- Errors with full tracebacks

**Log format:** JSON Lines (one event per line)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Levers Not Detected

**Problem:** Script loads but no levers turn green

**Possible Causes:**
1. Not in Tomb of Kings entrance area
2. Too far from levers (need to be within 25 tiles)
3. Levers already pulled by someone else

**Solutions:**
1. Walk closer to lever area
2. Enable debug mode and check logs for "LEVER_SCAN" events
3. Wait for levers to reset (if recently used)

---

### Levers Not Auto-Pulling

**Problem:** Levers are green but don't auto-pull when walking near

**Possible Causes:**
1. Not close enough (need to be exactly 1 tile away)
2. Lever already used
3. Server lag

**Solutions:**
1. Stand **directly adjacent** to lever (diagonal counts)
2. Check if lever turned red (already used)
3. Enable debug mode and check "DISTANCE_CHECK" events

---

### Script Stops Too Early

**Problem:** Script ends before all levers pulled or flames activated

**Possible Causes:**
1. TazUO stop button pressed accidentally
2. Script error (check for error messages)

**Solutions:**
1. Don't press stop button until flames are done
2. Enable debug mode and check for ERROR events in logs
3. Reload script and try again

---

### Flames Not Detected

**Problem:** All levers pulled but flames don't appear or script doesn't speak

**Possible Causes:**
1. Flames not spawned yet (server delay)
2. Too far from flames
3. Flame names changed by server

**Solutions:**
1. Wait a few seconds after last lever
2. Walk closer to flame locations
3. Enable debug mode and check "FLAME_SCAN" events
4. Report issue with log excerpt

## üìä Technical Details

### How It Works

**Scan-Once Pattern:**
- Script scans levers ONCE at startup
- Stores all lever data in memory (serial, position, name)
- Works from memory only - never re-scans changed items
- Avoids TazUO visual glitches from re-querying

**Detection Logic:**
- Lever graphic IDs: `4238` (0x108E) and `4236` (0x108C)
- Usable lever name: `"A Lever"`
- Unusable lever name: `"A Lever (unusable)"`
- Flame graphic ID: `6571` (both Order and Chaos)
- Flame names: `"Flame Of Order"` / `"Flame Of Chaos"`

**Auto-Use Logic:**
- Every 0.25 seconds (250ms polling)
- Checks distance to each lever
- Uses Chebyshev distance (max of dx, dy)
- Auto-uses if distance ‚â§ 1 tile
- 1.5 second cooldown after each use

**Safety Features:**
- Marks used levers immediately (prevents double-use)
- Ignores levers with "unusable" in name
- Stops automatically when complete
- No spam - one action per lever/flame

## üìù Script Architecture

```python
class TombOfKings:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize state
        self.scanned = False
        self.lever_data = {}
        self.used_levers = set()
    
    def run(self):
        # Main loop
        while not API.StopRequested:
            if not self.scanned:
                self.scan_levers()     # Once at startup
            
            self.check_and_use_levers()  # Every cycle
            self.check_flames()          # After levers done
            API.Pause(0.25)
    
    def cleanup(self):
        # Reset hues, clear state
```

**Key Principles:**
- Scan once, store forever
- Work from memory, not live queries
- Client-side hue changes only
- No server spam

## üö´ Limitations

### What This Script Does NOT Do

‚ùå Walk to levers automatically  
‚ùå Navigate the entrance maze  
‚ùå Handle combat with monsters  
‚ùå Open the dungeon entrance door  
‚ùå Farm inside the dungeon  

**You still need to:**
- Walk around the lever area yourself
- Handle any monsters that spawn
- Open the final entrance door manually
- Use separate scripts for dungeon farming

## üì¶ Files Created

After first run with debug mode:

```
ToK/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tomb_of_kings.py              # Main script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                     # This file

```

**Note:** No config files created. Script is fully self-contained.
